This document outlines the security practices and considerations for this project.

#### 1. Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We appreciate your help in keeping this project secure. 
If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly by opening a GitHub issue 
or via the discussion board.

The project maintainers will respond as soon as they can, 
and work with you to understand the nature and severity of the vulnerability,
and develop a fix and release a patch as soon as possible.

#### 2. Dependency Management

We use the standard Go dependency management tool to manage project dependencies. 
We strive to keep our dependencies up-to-date to address known security vulnerabilities.

#### 3. Secure Coding Practices

We follow secure coding practices to minimize the risk of introducing vulnerabilities into the codebase. 

This includes practices like:

* Input Validation: Sanitize and validate all user input to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
* Proper Authentication and Authorization: Implement strong authentication and authorization mechanisms to control access to sensitive data and functionalities.  
* Regular Code Reviews: Conduct regular code reviews to identify potential security issues.
* Avoiding secrets in the code.
* Avoiding collecting any user data.

#### 4. Keeping Up-to-Date

We encourage all users to stay up-to-date with the latest security patches for their operating systems, software, and libraries.
